### Briefly about myself:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a former chief-bartender in a local bar. Since my school years i was interested in frontend, backend and CS. But my life path went in a different direction.
I participated in the design and opening of a successful bar in the city. It gives me experience in team-works, planning, work with providers, design and project work.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, i'm quit from my work and spend my free time studying. I want to learn new and improve my old skills, participate in different projects and meet new people in my new field (for me :) ). Because it's great way to change my life and sometimes other lives.
